# ApexFarming
This is a basic python script that searches for things on your screen and when it finds a match it well press the respective keys. The primary and current function is for Apex AFK farming, because getting to level 10 is annoying.

Before running the start.bat, make sure to install python, open the command prompt, and type the following commands:
 • pip install pywin32                                                                                                                                                 
 • pip install keyboard                                                                                                                                                 
 • pip install pyautogui                                                                                                                                               
 • pip install opencv-python                                                                                                                                           
if your getting a "The Pillow package is required to use this function" error, use:                                                                                       
 • pip install Pillow --upgrade


NOTE: You can use this for ranked as well, only thing is that's kind of messed up, and it will only leave the game when the full team is dead.
